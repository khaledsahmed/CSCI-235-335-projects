Hi so the program I created is the Binomial Queue

All parts are completed.

What I struggled the most in was the remove function. It took me a while to realize that when swiping the values you also have to update the pointers in the has table.

The implementation that I used for part 3 was that I deleted cases 0,1,6, and 7 since they were not being used except for deletemin.

You can run the file as implemented in the assignment pdf. Shortcut would be to use the given words in the makefile.
