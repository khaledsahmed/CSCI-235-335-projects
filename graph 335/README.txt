Hi so the program I created Are the Graph Functions

All parts are completed.

What I stuggled the most was on Dijkstra's algorithm. I tried to implement in my code one struct
for the algorithm but it wasnt working for Dijkstra, however it did work for topological.
Eventually I realized that there was no way to do so because the vertexes were not connecting.
It took my a while to implememt two struct unfortunetly. 

You can run the file as implemented in the assignment pdf. Shortcut would be to use the given words in the makefile.
